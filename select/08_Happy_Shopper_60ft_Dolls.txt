The high street scene caught in between
The perfect broken plan
With the carpet burns we take our turns
Julie is a man

Inside the shop we take our stock
The curtain starts to move
She drags her feet along the street
And the neighbors disapprove

She's a happy shopper
The happy shopper
We are happy shoppers
The happy shopper

The husband's pissed
The kids are kissed
The place is a mess
The queue is still up to the till
She's trying on a dress

Julie, Julie, Julie, can't you fight?
The working class can kiss my ass
If the price is right

She's a happy shopper
The happy shopper
We are happy shoppers
The happy shopper

Come on, come on, come on down

She's a happy shopper
The happy shopper
We are happy shoppers
The happy shopper
