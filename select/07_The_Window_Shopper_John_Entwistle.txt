I'm waiting at the end of your garden
Waiting for you to turn on the light
I don't care if your husband's there
I'm hidden by the night

I can't afford to buy the kind of dirty books
That show naked ladies with big chests
I can't afford to pay a woman to keep we warm at night
But that don't mean that I can't show no interest.

There's no cause for alarm
I don't mean no harm
I'm just looking
I'm just hoping for a glimpse
Of something I've never had and never will
I'm just window shopping.

That's why I'm waiting at the end of your garden
Waiting for you to turn on the light
I don't care if your husband's there
I'm hidden by the night.

I can't afford to buy the kind of books
That show naked ladies with big chests
I can't afford to buy a woman to keep we warm at night
But that don't mean that I can't show no interest.

There's no cause for alarm
I don't mean no harm
I'm just looking
I'm just hoping for a glimpse
Of something I've never had and never will
I'm just window shopping.

That's why I'm waiting at the end of your garden
Waiting for you to turn on the light
Please don't draw the curtains
Or I won't sleep tonight.

I can't afford to buy the kind of dirty books
That show naked ladies with big chests
I can't afford to buy a woman to keep we warm at night
But that don't mean that I can't show no interest.

I can't afford to buy the kind of dirty books

I can't afford to buy a woman to keep we warm at night
But that don't mean that I can't show no interest.
